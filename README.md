# Uptime
A fast, minimalistic, and powerful monitoring tool built on modern technologies.

> ðŸš§ This project is in the development phase, new features will be added continuously.

## Motivation
I've always wanted to create a monitoring tool. The last impetus for starting this project was my dissatisfaction with
the stability of the "uptime-kuma" tool and the unmaintained "statiping". 
I wanted to make the most of the potential of the new Vue framework Nuxt 3, which also has support for the server layer. 
So that makes it a powerful tool for creating full-stack applications. I have big plans for the project, 
new features and technologies will be added. I will be happy if my idea of a completely robust and functional 
monitoring tool will be shared by the community.

Many thanks to the Nuxt team for their great work and support.
