## Motivation
I've always wanted to create a monitoring tool. The last impetus for starting this project was my dissatisfaction with the stability and functionality of the [uptime-kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) tool and the unmaintained [statiping](https://github.com/statping/statping). 
I wanted to make the most of the potential of the new Vue framework Nuxt 3, which also has support for the server layer. 
So that makes it a powerful tool for creating full-stack applications. **I have big plans for the project**, 
new features and technologies will be added. I will be happy if my idea of a completely robust and functional 
monitoring tool will be shared by the community.

💚 Many thanks to the [Nuxt team](https://nuxtjs.org/teams/) for their great work and support.
